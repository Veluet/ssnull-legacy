It's the smallest piece in the series, coming in at a size smaller than a standard sheet of letter sized paper.  Maybe it's the whimsical subject, or the combination of everything that went right when printing the piece, but it's one of my favorites in the collection.  This is further heightened by the fact that once it's brought back into the digital world the colors and line definition absolutely explode."

It's no wonder I hated this piece from start to finish.  Frustrated at it's careless gaze I took the liberty of defacing the image with a heavy slash of thick black ink.  It's only when brought into a digital world does it's true nature begin to shine."
